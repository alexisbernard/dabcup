### DABCUP ###

### What is it? ###
Dabcup is a tool in order to handle databases backups easily. You can centralize
all you backup policies on a single server, and then store dumps to many different
hosts (SSH, S3, FTP).

### How does it work? ###
You just need to describe your policies in a simple configuration (see conf/dabcup.yml)
and then run the command: `dabcup foo dump` to backup your database 'foo'.

### How to install it? ###
You need Ruby plus the following gems: aws-s3 and net-ssh.

sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems
sudo gem install aws-s3 net-ssh
