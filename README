./dabcup.rb mysite.com clean                # Deletes old backups as specified in ~/.dabcup/.profiles.yml
./dabcup.rb myblog.com list                 # Lists all backups available

The list of databases to backup and storage informations are in ~/.dabcup/profiles.yml.
The sample file is well documented and easily understanding.
